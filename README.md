This is my first optional project for RB175 / RB185, in preparation for the project assessment for RB189. I have chosen the first suggested project on the list.

Project prompt:

"A contact list application that tracks contacts and their names, phone numbers, and email addresses. To add more complexity, assign contacts to categories (friends, family, work, etc)."

I will start with the basic functionality, and then add the complexity of categories on top of that if I can within a 50 hour maximum time limit, in order to mimic testing conditions.
